<h1>Colleges in the U.S. vs Colleges Around the World</h1>

<div class="container story">
<div class="row">
<div class="offset-md-2 col-sm-8">


<p>The U.S. college system is unique. It is significantly different from other college systems countries around the world. Universities and colleges are more expensive here, the college experience is different and there are more types of universities. That is simply scratching the surface, though. There are many differences, and there are fundamental reasons for those differences.</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="offset-md-2 col-sm-8">
<h4>ACCEPTANCE RATES</h4>

<p>The acceptances rates for universities in the U.S. are thought to be lower than those in other countries, but there are exceptions. For example, Hanyang University in South Korea and University of Campinas in Brazil have acceptance rates of 3% and 4% respectively, while Harvard University has an acceptance rate of 5%. Therefore, acceptance rates are not a significant factor in differences between U.S. and international universities.</p>

<h4>APPLICATION</h4>

<p>The application process in the U.S. is similar to other countries in many ways. Multiple countries use the Common App, which is one of the mostly widely used college applications in the U.S. It represents approximately 900 schools in all 50 states and in 20 countries.</p>

<p>Also, many other countries have college entrance exams as well. The U.S. has the SAT and ACT, and while some schools have gone test-optional, many still require students to submit their scores on those assessments. Other countries, like China, Japan, South Korea and Brazil have assessments as well.</p>

<h4>COST</h4>

<p>Colleges in the U.S. are more expensive than those in many other countries. In fact, many countries have free tuition for their students. For example, Germany and Sweden have free tuition for their students and Denmark goes one step further by providing students with money for living expenses while in college. Also, The University of Tokyo is not free, but it is approximately $4,735 per year, which is much cheaper.</p>

<p>In contrast, U.S. universities cost an average of $35,720 per year. However, costs in the U.S. based on what type of university it is, and there are many different types.</p>

<h4>TYPES OF COLLEGES: PUBLIC vs PRIVATE</h4>

<p>The U.S. has different types of colleges: public colleges, non-profit private colleges and for-profit private colleges. U.S. in-state and out-of-state 4 year universities cost $25,864 and $43,721 per year respectively. Non-profit four year private universities are on average $53,949 per year, and for-profit universities< are $34,548 per year.</p>

<p>Public universities are funded by federal, state and local governments and taxpayers, while private universities are primarily funded by donors and tuition dollars, which contributes to the higher tuition costs. Public universities can offer a lower tuition to residents of the state, which private universities cannot do. Then, private schools are also often smaller than public schools.</p>

<h4>WHY IS THE COST SO MUCH HIGHER IN THE U.S.?</h4>

<p>In the U.S., colleges spend a lot more money on their students. That is one of the reasons why the cost is so much higher.</p> 

<p>Many other countries do not provide the same college experience that the U.S. does. In fact, U.S. college students are the most likely to live away from home. For example, colleges in Canada and Europe have fewer dorms and dining halls than the U.S. does. In fact, the U.S. spends more than any other nation in the world on student-welfare services such as housing, meals, health care, and transportation.</p>

<p>However, it is not just on-campus housing and dining plans that increase the amount U.S. schools spend on their students. Colleges spend more for funding academics and paying professors and faculty than their counterparts abroad as well.</p>

<p>One solution is for the U.S. colleges to decrease the amount they spend on their students. This would fundamentally change the long-standing higher education system and college experience for many students. Based on how colleges are here, it will be difficult for them to lower tuition and other students costs. </p>
